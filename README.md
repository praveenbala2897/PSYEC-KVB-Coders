ABSTRACT - Flood of information is produced in a daily basis through the global internet usage arising from the online interactive communications
among users. While this situation contributes significantly to the quality of human life, unfortunately it involves enormous dangers, since online texts with high toxicity
can cause personal attacks, online harassment and bullying behaviors. This has triggered both industrial and research community in the last few years while there are several tries
to identify an efficient model for online toxic comment prediction.However, these steps are still in their infancy and new approaches and frameworks are required. In this work, we employ this approach to discover
toxic comments in a large pool of documents provided by a current Kaggle’s competition regarding Wikipedia’s talk page edits.
